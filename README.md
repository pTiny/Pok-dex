# Pokedex
Pokédex application for the Kanto region.

Uses Tkinter and the Pokemon API (public). It doesn't run fast and tends to lag quite a bit but it does work, just give it time. Probably could be written better, or maybe it's because of Python's speed itself, either way as of now it's the best I got.

If you intend on using this script yourself make sure you edit the strings containing the location of the images used (sprites and Pokémon logo image) before running, else it just won't work. The sprites can be found in the zip file (titled "sprite_NAME.jpg") and the logo is in this repo too.
