# Pokedex
Pok√©dex application for the Kanto region.

Uses Tkinter and the Pokemon API (it's public). It doesn't run fast and tends to lag quite a bit but it does work, just give it time. Probably could be written better, or maybe it's because of Python's speed itself, either way as of now it's the best I got.
